- Using the Solution Explorer view on the right side, double-click on the algorithm you want to run to open the code
- Right-click anywhere on the code and click "Start without debugging"

- The generated search and solution files are stored in a separate folder for each algorithm
- ScaledGBFS runs the scaled up puzzle for part 2.5
